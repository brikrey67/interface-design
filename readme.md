# Interface Design

As web developers it is our job to build products. Whether your applications are built for consumers or internal use, it is important to remember that you are building a product for real people. People who have experience, knowledge, bias, and preference that is uniquely different from yours. **Identify your target user and learn from them.**

## Universal Principals of Design

The content in this section is inspired by a book I highly recommend for anyone working in product design. You! *Universal Principles of Design* is exactly what it seems. It is a huge repository of design considerations that can and should be applied to the design of tea kettles, elevators, propaganda, space shuttles, and everything in between.

Today we will touch on a few important considerations when building the interface of a website or application.

### Cost vs Benefit

Closely consider the benefits of using your application. What is the app designed to do? How might it make a users life easy, happy, healthy, knowledgeable, productive, or fun? While it is fun and easy to imagine our applications' positive impact on users, it is important to remember that there is always an associated cost. Costs come in many forms: money, time, ...decisions?
