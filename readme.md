# Interface Design

As web developers it is our job to build products. Whether your applications are built for consumers or internal use, it is important to remember that you are building a product for real people. People who have experience, knowledge, bias, and preference that is uniquely different from yours. **Identify your target user and learn from them.**

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss several general principals of design
- Introduce user experience design (UX)

## Universal Principals of Design

The content in this section is inspired by a book I highly recommend for anyone working in product design. You! *Universal Principles of Design* is exactly what it seems. It is a huge repository of design considerations that can and should be applied to the design of tea kettles, elevators, propaganda, space shuttles, and everything in between.

Today we will touch on a few important considerations when building the interface of a website or application.

### Cost vs Benefit

Closely consider the benefits of using your application. What is the app designed to do? How might it make a users life easy, happy, healthy, knowledgeable, productive, or fun? While it is fun and easy to imagine our applications' positive impact on users, it is important to remember that there is always an associated cost. Costs come in many forms: money, time, ...decisions?

  > **loading:** People are impatient. The longer a user has to wait, the more likely they are to use an alternative product.
  > **sign up:** Forms are annoying and nobody enjoys sharing unnecessary personal information. Unless signing up is critical to an app's benefit, it will be perceived as a cost.
  > **onboarding:** It takes time and energy to learn a new skill or tool. Simplify onboarding as much as possible and focus on features that are critical to the core functionality of the app.
  > **complexity:** People become overwhelmed by complexity and can become paralyzed if given too many options. Give your app a KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)

#### Hick's Law

Hick's law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number of present choices. Users feel confident, empowered, and happy when they are able to easily navigate an application and they are frustrated when they can't find what they're looking for. Consider Hick's law when designing navigation and menu options. Group related navigation links together. Present the most used functions and hide advanced features for users to learn with time.
